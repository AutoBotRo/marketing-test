            <p>Hello David Shank,</p>

            <p>We know how disappointing it can be to receive an item that just doesn't work, so we're going to do everything we can to make this process quick and easy. This e-mail explains the return process to give you a better understanding of how we do things.</p>
 
            <p>Attached to the e-mail is a return-shipping label. Please print this label out, tape it to the shipping box (making sure to cover any old labels!) and drop it off at your local FedEx facility. We can even call FedEx to schedule a pick-up for you. Once the warehouse notifies us that your order has been received, we'll provide you with your refund!</p>
            <p>Now, follow the instructions below to make sure your return arrives to us safe and sound:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Use your original box or any plain, unmarked cardboard box.</li>
                <li>Remember to remove any pre-existing labels or stickers from the shipping box.</li>
                <li>Attach your new return label to the shipping box.</li>
                <li>Seal your box completely.</li>
                <li>Drop it off at your local FedEx facility.</li>
            </ul>

 
            <p>Please let us know if you have any questions! We're always here to lend a hand.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>Cool-off.com Customer Service</p>
